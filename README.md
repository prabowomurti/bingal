# Bingal Is Not a Go tutoriAL

Hello, everyone. I write a journey of my Golang learning process on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJvI9Y2aBBnv8Mog1J_aQ1rhQ0hJlIbop). It's just a documentation of me enjoying the Go dev tour.

All related code will be available here, and the folder matched my video episode number.

Enjoy.
